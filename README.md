# Cooperative Delivery

This project provides the main code for the IEEE ICDE 2024 Round 2 submission 1548 entitled *Cooperative Air-Ground Instant Delivery by UAVs and Crowdsourced Taxis*.
***

**Highlighted Features**
- The delivery capacities of the UAVs and the taxis are quantified.
- The potential delivery orders are predicted.
- A heuristic schedule algorithm is designed to improve the delivery efficiency.


*cooperation.py* achieves the cooperative delivery process of UAVs and taxis.
