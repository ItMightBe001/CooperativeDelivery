# Cooperative Delivery

This project provides the main code for the IEEE ICDE 2024 Second Round Submission 1548 entitled *Cooperative Air-Ground Instant Delivery by UAVs and Crowdsourced Taxis*.
***

**Highlighted Features**
- The delivery capacities of the UAVs and the taxis are quantified.
- The potential delivery orders are predicted.
- A heuristic schedule algorithm is designed to improve the delivery efficiency.


**Datasets**
- The historical delivery data is available at [Alibaba Tianchi], which is released by Yi Ding et al. and Yu Yang et al.
- The taxi trajectory data is available at [Github].
- The contextual data is collected from [Time And Date] and [Open Street Map]

We only submit the core cooperation algorithm code (*cooperation.py*), the data processing codes will be submitted if requested.
